# MTGATracker Code of Conduct

MTGATracker is free and open-source software. This means that anyone can create a GitHub account, and create a pull request
to improve MTGATracker. However, for the safety of our community, any person doing so should read and understand this code of conduct, as
their act of contribution will be considered an implicit agreement to it.

Any contributor who breaks these pledges may be removed from the MTGATracker community (including their contributions) with or without notice.

## MTGATracker Pledges

### MTGATracker is free and open source, forever

MTGATracker is not, and never will be paid software. MTGATracker is not, and will not be ad supported.  MTGATracker does not
and will not generate profit directly from it's software.

MTGATracker is developed with love--not money--and any attempts to raise funds must be explicitly
done so in an opt-in fashion, and also must only be either at the benefit of the community, or explicitly to recoup
costs already spent.

MTGATracker developers are fierce proponents of open software. Any code a user runs on their machine should always
be traceable back to source, both for safety and for accountability. There should never be a penalty for
running MTGATracker from source, rather than running a published binary.

(We won't rule out things like selling stickers or T-Shirts ;) but again, efforts such as these must be done so only to
recoup costs already spent.)

### MTGATracker does not own your data

MTGATracker and it's develoeprs and contributors do not make any claim to your personal data.

MTGATracker may use industry-standard data analytics tools when users visit their websites, so as to better understand the community that uses MTGATracker.

MTGATracker users must always be in control of their personal information, and any attempt
made by MTGATracker to collect any personally-identifiable information must be **strictly opt-in**.
MTGATracker will only collect data without consent if it is strictly in aggregate, and only if that data **cannot** be attributed back
to the originating user uniquely. (Yes, this includes e.g. deck data!)

For example, MTGATracker may count the number of games as user has tracked using the program, and may assign those games a unique, random
identifier (so that MTGATracker can understand the number of individual users running the program), but MTGATracker must only correlate that information
back to a user's personal info (e.g. your username) **strictly with that user's freely-given consent.**

Similarly, MTGATracker **must not** collect (e.g.) the cards a user has chosen to put in their deck, or (e.g.) the number of times a user has been on the play
vs. on the draw, without that user's explicit consent to do so.

Whenever MTGATracker does collect data (with or without explicit consent), clear examples of the data collected must be published
**exhaustively** in the [MTGATracker privacy policy](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/blob/master/legal/privacy.md).

(Early adopters of MTGATracker may notice that this is a shift from when MTGATracker originally started, and this is true. We had a
lot of fun playing with user's data at the start, but we've decided that doing so was ultimately unethical, and didn't positively contribute to MTG.)

### MTGATracker loves Magic

MTGATracker developers love Magic, and should always do their best to do what is best for the game. If a feature is unethical or
may cause damage the game (for example, by excessively contributing to a stale meta), MTGATracker devs should avoid, or even outright
reject implementing such a feature.

MTGATracker developers are fiercely protective of the integrity of the game. MTGATracker developers are allowed to have opinions about
what is and is not considered "cheating," but any ambiguity should be treated with extreme scrutiny.

If a MTGATracker developer learns of (e.g.) an exploit in MTGA, they must not use it to gain any advantage, and must
make no effort to exploit it (in MTGATracker code or otherwise).

### MTGATracker and keeping secrets

MTGATracker must keep some information secret (for example, passwords used to upload python binary distributions to PyPI.
These secrets must be kept strictly to protect the integrity of MTGATracker binaries, and therefore to protect MTGATracker users.

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at devs.mtgatracker@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
